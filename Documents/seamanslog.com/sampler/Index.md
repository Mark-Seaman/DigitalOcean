# Seaman's Log 

## Author's Journal

I am writing daily for a number of different publishing venues.  This blog
provides you will a sampling of the content that I am writing.  Each day I will
publish a snippet of content from one of the websites that I have created.
A short sample message will be followed with a hyperlink to read the full
article in detail.

This is a great way to see what I am working on without being swamped with
information in your inbox.  The messages can easily be retweeted or posted on
other social media.
