## Meaningful Work

At the very heart of meaningful work is the urge to create. This can take on many forms. Creativity may be expressed in writing, software design, teaching techniques or just plain old problem solving. A day without creativity is like a day without sunshine.

There are several core attributes of meaning in work life. If any of these is missing it will be impossible to have a sense of fulfillment related to work. It is worth spending time regularly thinking about the factors which provide the motivation that you need.
