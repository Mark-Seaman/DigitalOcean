# Embrace Truth

Our lives are spent trying to make sense of the reality that surrounds us.  Each
time we gain insight we have a truth to share.

**"Life is What Happens To You While You're Busy Making Other Plans.”** — John
Lennon.

When your plans are interrupted and life takes a bum turn, reality has asserted
itself on you. This is certain to generate passion, in the form of Joy, Fear,
Anger, Sadness, and Shame.   

Use this emotional energy to embrace new levels of understanding and insight. 
For me writing is never about communicating with others.  It is more about
galvanizing the understanding of events in my life.  The struggle to learn and
grow from pain or joy can be very interesting to others.

Most of my writing is about embracing reality in my own life.  These truths can
then be shared with others in the form of insights.  If these experiences are
presented as a story then others can readily relate.
