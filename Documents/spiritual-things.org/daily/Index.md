## Overview

Time Alone with God is the most worthwhile endeavor possible.

But it is often neglected as our time is filled with busy activities.

Daily Meditations gives you some resources to make your time more enjoyable, inspiring, and meaningful.

Each day presents you with some scriptures to meditate on and a prayer to apply the
truth to your life today.
