# A Seaman's Journey

For the past several years I have begun telling stories from my life.
I've had a number of unusual experiences that are worth sharing with
others.

Over recent months, I have begun collecting them into a book, 
"A Seaman's Journey - Adventures of a Lifetime".  This book focuses
on the many experiences that had a profound impact on how I think
and behave.

I am moving toward publishing this material as soon as possible, but 
will not rush it.  You can read this book at any time while it is 
still under development.  When ready the content from the website
will be built into the ebook format and placed in the Amazon Kindle
book store.

When you find mistakes (you are certain to) then contact me by email
and I'll get then corrected immediately. I am editing this text 
daily and welcome your participation.

Also free free to suggest new stories and react to things I've 
written.  The more input I get the better the resulting book will 
be.

Enjoy ...
