# Descent Into Hatred

by Mark Seaman

---

Five stages of hatred


### Step 1 - Bigotry

- Human nature is motivated by self-interest
- We don't care about the suffering of the weak and poor
- We want more wealth and power
- All people unlike us are enemies

### Step 2 - White Supremacy

- We believe that our group has a right to rule
- We set the standard for culture and language
- Others are tolerated if they agree to be like us
- Racism, Sexism, Agism, and Capitalism are good and healthy
- If you are not a WASP you are a threat
- Poverty is caused by laziness
- Liberals are communists in hiding

### Step 3 - Nationalism

- America is the best country on earth
- America has a right to rule the entire world
- God is on our side
- Patriotism is the willingness to fight
- Freedom means I get my way
- I love the 2nd Amendment
- Voting should be limited to descent people

### Step 4 - Christian Nationalism

- America is a Christian nation
- Liberals are trying to infiltrate the government
- Take back the government from the socialists
- Fox News reports news
- Conspiracy theories are often right
- Sometimes violence is necessary
- 90% of the people are enemies of America
- First they take your guns, then your freedom

### Step 5 - Theocracy

- After we control the government we will get rid of elections
- The laws must be changed to protect our wealth and power
- We will eliminate the taxes for the rich
- We will remove the so called "Safety Net" and other socialist programs
- Corporations will operate without regulations
- We need to enlarge the budget for defense
- Bring back the death penalty and build more prisons
- Create the "Kingdom of Heaven" on earth
